# Water Filling CC


This program checks whether Chef needs to fill her water bottles. Each bottle is either full (1) or empty (0). For each test case, we take the values of three bottles. By adding the three values (B1 + B2 + B3), we can count how many bottles are full. If at most one is full (i.e., at least two are empty), Chef will fill them, and the program prints "Water filling time".

If the sum is greater than 1 (meaning two or more bottles are already full), then Chef will not fill the bottles and the output is "Not now". This logic is repeated for every test case provided in the input.
